<h1>Summary</h1>
Goo Surge was a game made in two weeks by me and 3 of my coursemates on the Newcastle University Games Engineering Course. We had a large gap between Christmas and returning to university, so we decided to make productive use of our time and do a game jam together. We decided upon the Pirate Software Game Jam as the dates lined up well, and doing a 2 week game jam gave us much more time to get used to working with eachother and setting up the project.

When starting the jam, we agreed that we wanted to focus on making something interesting from a technical standpoint, and to challenge ourselves to do something we hadn't programmed before.

<h1>Gameplay</h1>
The player controls a wizard who has been tasked to break out the imprisoned goo, steal schematics and destroy as much of the facility as they can.
Our main gameplay mechanic was the goo. In our game, there is an ever expanding pool of goo, which spreads throughout the level, and the player can alter its properties by either heating it up (making it faster and more destructive) or cooling it down (making it slower and safer). When the goo is hot, it can destroy objects and walls in the level, giving the player points and opening up new areas of the level, but it can also hurt the player, so they need to be careful.

<h1>Drawing runes</h1>
The rune drawing mechanic was not programmed by me, instead being made by Alex. Because of this, I do not know all the technical details on how it works.
From a gameplay standpoint, the mechanic was a good addition to the game, as it added some extra challenge and tension. However, it also added frustration for the player when they thought they drew a rune correctly, only for the game to not recognise it.
<h1>What went well</h1>
On a technical level, I am very happy with what we managed to achieve as a team.
<h1>What I would improve</h1>
Feedback from people who played the game seemed to be mixed, with most people commenting on the interesting mechanics and liking the overall style, but finding the game to be too confusing or the goals to be poorly communicated. I definitely agree that the aim of the game was not clear enough, and the game should definitely had a tutorial, or at least more instruction on what to do. If I could go back, I would add an arrow on the UI to point the player to where they need to go.
