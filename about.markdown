Hi, I'm HeavyMetalGameDev, or Matthew, an aspiring games programmer looking to get into the industry. I graduated from the MComp Computer Science with Games Engineering course at Newcastle University with a first class degree, and have been looking to break into the profession since.
My programming interests vary: I typically find any aspect of games programming interesting, especially more technical tasks.

**I am currently working on:**

- Caldwell Concoctions Steam Release. I intend to release my game jam game, The Case of Caldwell Concoctions, on Steam for free!
- Unnamed Shooter Project. I am working on a small first-person shooter game with some friends, which we intend to have a short development cycle and to release on Steam for free once polished.
- Hogworld. Hogworld was born out of the intention to create a finished, interesting game, and will be a small videogame created in Unity. My main reason for doing this project was to try some systems I have not done before, such as programming a tile based world and interaction system from scratch, a dialogue system, and an ability system.


(I also like metal music.)
