Hi, I'm HeavyMetalGameDev, or Matthew, an MComp Computer Science with Games Engineering student at Newcastle University, currently in my 4th and final year.
I'll be graduating in 2024 and will be looking to enter the industry as a Graduate Games Programmer!
My programming interests vary: I typically find any aspect of games programming interesting, especially more technical tasks.

**I am currently working on:**

-Hogworld. Hogworld was born out of the intention to create a finished, interesting game, and will be a small videogame created in Unity. My main reason for doing this project was to try some systems I have not done before, such as programming a tile based world and interaction system from scratch, a dialogue system, and an ability system.

(I also like metal music.)
